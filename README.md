## How it Works

We collected more than 4500 images, categorized, and then labeled them. Using these 4500 images that represented different weather, ligthing, day,
and night conditions; we trained our neural network. We have used django framework with python for backend, javaScript, CSS, and HTML for front end.
Our neural network has an accuracy of 99.5% which makes it an highly accurate neural network.
